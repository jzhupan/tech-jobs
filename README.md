# companies-to-apply.com

The purpose of this page/repository is to allow anyone to quickly find companies and their job postings.

# Styling

Currently all the code is formatted using Prettier (default settings). The usage of Prettier is still being discussed, but as of now it is part of the development cycle. Using it will probably save us from merge conflicts.
